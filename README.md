A simple 3D-2D projection library for small screens on Arduino

## getting started
To get started:
* [Download this project](https://github.com/menehune23/projection/archive/master.zip). Once downloaded, you can unzip it and import the "Projection" subfolder into your Arduino environment. It contains well-documented library source files as well as example code for <a href="http://sfe.io/p12923" target="_blank">MicroView</a>.
* Or, [clone this project](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/menehune23/projection).

## working with OBJ files
In the "Projection" folder is a simple converter tool, _ObjConverter.html_, that will convert a simple OBJ file to C++ code that you can copy into your source file. It should run in most modern browsers (no internet required). See the example "ModelFromOBJFile" to see how to work with the generated code.

For a free 3D modeling program that can export to the OBJ format, see <a href="http://blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a>.
